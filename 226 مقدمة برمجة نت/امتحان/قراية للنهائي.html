        <p>"The base tag is to put the base link that all other links in the page rely on, used for better SEO"</p>
        <p>"The script for client side scripts such as PHP , jg"</p>
        <p>"Style for containing embedded CSS tags"</p>
        <p>"block element rendered with br before and after it, and take full width such as: <br>p <br>div <br>h1 to h6<br> form<br> lists tags"</p>
        <p>"Inline elements are used only for dressing within the block element, such as:<br>img<br>a<br>span<br>strong<br>code<br>i<br>input<br>button"</p>
        <p>"Attribues do be included in the opening tag, some are tag specific some are globalally used, such as:<br>styl tag<br>id tag<br>class tag<br>title tag</title>"</p>
        <p>title attribute: provides explaingni text for objects when mouse is placed on them</p>
        <p>style attribute: provides in-line styling with css tags, not favrod method</p>

        <p>id attribute: its unique for each object, can't be used by any other object across files</p>
        <p>class atrribute: its used to identify a group of related objects</p>

        <p>heading tags, h1 to h6:<br> used to show the outline of ur webpage from first topic or part h1,to last topi or part h6<br>not to make a text bold or large</p>
        <p>using pre <pre>tag    u 
            /can  format        
            
            
            
            text</pre></p>
            <p>Also the a tag to display links:<a href="https://www.google.com/">Google Search</a> it can be put on img as well</p>
            <p>the a href when it includes https is called absolute, when only google.com its called relative</p>
            <p>targer=_blank to open new window</p>
        <p>finally, br tag:<br>press F12 to see the code<br> and hr tag: <hr></p>

        <p>bookmarks are really useful, used by combining id attribuet and a href<br>give the outline in the begging an id, then use a href="#id_name" on the element.<br>
        such as: <a href="#h1">go to h1</a>
        <p>to send an email to user use mailto inside the href: <a href="mailto:me@uot.edu.ly"> mail@uot.edu.ly</a> hover over it and look down at the page</p>
        <p>image can be of a great use, use img tag with src attribue as follows <img src="4.jpg" title="lab-exam 2 qs" width="550px" height="550px"></p>
        <p> the src attribue in the img tag can be used to provide and alternative text describing it when the image doesn't load or for screen readers
            such as: <img src="7.jpg" alt="used 7.jpg which doesn't exist, forcing the display of alt text">
        </p>

        <p>now we introduece the <img src="3.jpg" alt="4th picture"><figcaption>…………………</figcaption> </p>
