        Ukraine war: Fighting set to slow for
        winter months, says US intelligence
      </h3>

        Let’s get this out of the way upfront: Plenty of people use portable devices — phones, chiefly, but also mobile
        gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch and the Steam Deck — while on the toilet. There’s a good chance, in
        fact, that you’re reading this article on the toilet
        Incredibly, a few surveys have been conducted on the subject. In one conducted by NordVPN earlier this year, 65%
        of respondents (of 9,800 adults surveyed) said they used their phones in the bathroom. But it also just feels
        anecdotally true. The habit isn’t a new one; people have kept books and magazines by the porcelain throne for
        decades. With ever-smaller and more portable devices in our pockets, it seems intuitive that we would turn to
        those devices in a quiet moment.
        “Look, there are two types of people in the world,” said Nir Eyal, an author and lecturer who writes about
        habits, focus and human behavior. “People who check their phone in the bathroom, and people who lie about
        checking their phone in the bathroom.”

        The practice is normally kept behind locked bathroom doors and left politely undiscussed. But in October, there
        was a vibe shift, brought about by the release of “Marvel Snap,” a new card game available on phones and
        tablets. “Marvel Snap is the best game to play on the toilet currently,” tweeted popular streamer and content
        creator Saqib “Lirik” Zahid to his almost 650,000 followers. “I hate Marvel Snap and so does my toilet seat,”
        blared a headline on the video game website VG247. And although full disclosure may not be desired by readers of
        an article like this one, I feel compelled to say: I too play “Marvel Snap” on the toilet. I’m Spartacus!

        Which prompted the question: Is it healthy to sit on the toilet with a phone? I turned to a gastroenterologist
        for answers.
        “You generally don’t want to spend more than about on average about 10 minutes,” said Dr. Roshini Raj, a
        gastroenterologist at NYU Langone,
        and the author of “Gut Renovation,” a book about digestive health.
        Though Raj acknowledged that — like with many things in medicine — there’s not a one size fits all answer, she
        pointed to three potential pain points for preoccupied poopers.

        More subtly, there’s also the risk of your body starting to ignore its own signals.
        Peristalsis is the name for the progressive contractions that move stool through the intestine to the rectum.
        But sitting on the toilet for long periods of time not doing anything can hinder that process.

        The move angered the United States and other Western nations with Washington accusing the group of siding with
        Russia.
        Since October, oil prices have declined due to slower global growth and higher interest rates. Opec sources say
        the group is likely to approve a policy rollover.
        Meanwhile, Ukraine's security service said the government in Kyiv is imposing sanctions against 10 senior
        Orthodox Church figures it accuses of having supported Russia's invasion.
        The sanctions, which will freeze their assets for five years, are the latest moves by the Ukrainian government
        against religious groups seen as potentially subversive.
