  <p>One of the reasons Jim Carrey became as successful as he did is thanks to his physical acting. While there are
    many examples of this,
    perhaps the best is in Me, Myself, & Irene. The romantic comedy features Carrey as Charlie, a Rhode Island
    police officer who suffers from dissociative identity disorder.
    Charlie is roped into an assassination plot with the beautiful Irene,
    and it takes both Charlie, and his alter ego Hank to get the job done. It is one thing for an actor to play more
    than one character,
    such as Mike Myers, but it is something else entirely to play two different characters in one body, often
    simultaneously.</p>
